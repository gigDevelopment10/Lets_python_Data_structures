1. Target Sum in an Array 
* Which two elements guve the target sum ?
  Approaches -> Brute Force O(n^3)
             -> Optimize Brute force O(n^2)
             -> Two Pointer Method O(n) Needs Sorted array
             -> Hashing O(n) Works on ordered list 
             -> Remainder Hashing O(n+x)
