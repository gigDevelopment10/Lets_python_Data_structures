**Q. which method is faster Iterative or recursive ?** <br>
In general, iterative methods are faster than recursive methods in terms of execution time because iterative methods use looping constructs which can be optimized by compilers, whereas recursive methods require function calls, which are slower and more memory-intensive. However, the performance difference between the two can vary depending on the specific problem being solved and the implementation. 
In some cases, recursive algorithms can be faster and more elegant, especially for problems that have a natural recursive structure.
